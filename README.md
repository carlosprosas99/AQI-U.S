# AQI-U.S
•	Created a program with a colleague using Pandas and matplotlib libraries that will allow a user to look at pollution data in the United States using a CSV file on Dataset Search.com.

•	Designed and implemented a user-friendly Generated User Interface (GUI) program to enable users to access pollution data for specific states from 2000 to 2021 or compare pollution levels among the top 5, 10, or 15 states in a selected year.

•	Incorporated features prompting users to select pollution types and confirm search entries for enhanced usability.

•	The program generates a color-coded bar graph displaying pollution levels for the specified year or a range from 2000 to 2021. Additionally, it includes a legend featuring the Air Quality Index for clarity and ease of interpretation.
